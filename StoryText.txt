It is a period of CIVIL WARS in the galaxy. A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has
challenged the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE. Striking from a fortress
hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, Rebel spaceships have won their first victory in a
battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat could bring a
thousand more solar systems into the REBELLION, and Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost
forever. To crush the REBELLION once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle
station, the DEATH GLOBE. Powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, its completion spells
certain doom for the CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM.
-
Your mission, Rebel, is to find the six pieces of the plans for the DEATH GLOBE that the EMPIRE hid inside of it.
Once you recover all six pieces, return to the starting room to be picked up by your allies.
Most importantly, DO NOT let Dirth Nader catch you...

This room is fairly empty, except for a few dummies dressed as Rebels.

Congratulations, Rebel! You recovered all six pieces of the plans for the evil DEATH GLOBE.
This is an incredible victory for the REBELLION and a devastating loss for the EMPIRE.
